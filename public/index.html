            The Educational Research Integration Area (ERIA) studies how
            interactive digital tools -- like video games -- might transform
            learning. Our goal is to improve public understanding of science
            through games. These games are designed to be used in homes, schools,
            and after school settings, because we think the future of learning
            lies in connected learning across these contexts. Tomorrow's learners
            will access learning resources on their digital tablets, phones, and
            computers, and our learner profiles will cross these contexts.
            Learners, parents, teachers, and administrators unprecedented
            opportunities for using data to improve learning.               
            
            <br />
            <br />
            
            To reach tomorrow's learners, educational materials have to be deeply
            engaging. We build games can capture intrinsically interesting aspects
            of science and present it authentically to learners of all ages. We
            firmly believe that education should be energizing and life enhancing.
            Our games seek to put players in roles where they use science to do
            interesting things, setting up opportunities for learners to develop
            new identities -- and potentially even careers -- as people who
            affiliate with science.

            Our team is a part of the Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery, a unique
            interdisciplinary research facility. We are a part of a thriving
            research community that researchers information exchange from cells to
            societies -- and then seeks to use these discoveries to improve
            society. By working closely with scientists in a collaborative
            environment, we believe that we can link learning from the biological
            level to the social level, and create new learning experiences that
            transform how we learn.
